# 📊 Calories and Exercise Predictor

This application is a Streamlit-based web app designed to predict calories burned during exercise using a Linear Regression model. The app is ideal for users interested in health and fitness data analysis.

## 🔗 Demo

Check out the live app here: [![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://regreappr-calorie-prediction.streamlit.app/)

## ⚙️ App Features

- **Prediction Model**: Uses a Linear Regression model to predict the calories burned based on exercise data.
- **Data Visualization**: Includes visualizations to explore relationships between exercise metrics like duration and intensity.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Allows users to input their own exercise data for real-time calorie predictions.

## 📈 Model Details

The Linear Regression model is trained on exercise data (`calories_and_exercis.ipynb`) to predict calories burned based on several factors:

- **Duration**: How long the exercise lasts
- **Intensity**: How intense the exercise is
- **Additional Features**: Other available data in the dataset

The app integrates the dataset and model for live, interactive predictions.
